# Edgardo's Analytics Portfolio

## [Project 1: Cyclistic bike service]
This is a project I did as part of the google data analytics course. It is a capstone project where I got practice with all the tools and my recently learned data skills.
- The data is from the divvy bike sharing service and is publicly available.
- I did exploratory data analysis in R, made visualizations with ggplot2, and worked with the tidyverse libraries.
- Created visualizations in tableau and a made a presentation sharing my insights and recomendations.

## [Project 2: Second google case study] WIP
This is the second project of the google data analytics course. I'll do this after finishing the first one.
- R data analysis
- R visualizations
- Tableau visualizations
- Presentation

## [Project 3: Kaggle dataset analysis]
I will perform data analysis with R or python on a publicly available dataset, working all the data analysis cycle, preparing, business question, cleaning data, analysis, visualie, etc.

I will perform the data analysis cycle with python scrapping the data from an online source, spotify API or likewise.
- Python
- Other technologies to do live data analysis or change over time.
- Plotly?
- Etc.

## [Project 5: Machine learning model for NASA Jet Cycle data analysis]
I intend to build a machine learning model to perform predictions of remaining useful life for NASA's jet engines. This is an old dataset nasa made public for these kind of analysis.
- Python only
- Proper visualizations and documentation
