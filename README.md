# Edgardo's Analytics Portfolio

## [Project 1: Cyclistic bike service (Google Case Study)](https://github.com/rojedel/cyclistic-capstone-project/blob/main/Cyclsitic-Data-Analysis-Final.html)
This is a project I did as part of the google data analytics course. It is a capstone project where I got practice with all the tools and my recently learned data skills. The business task: Analyze Cyclistics bike sharing service usage data to find trends and insights into how different customer types use the service to find
ways to convert casual members into subscribers. 
- The data is from the divvy bike sharing service and is publicly available.
- I did exploratory data analysis in R, made visualizations with ggplot2, and worked with the tidyverse libraries.
- Created visualizations in tableau and a made a presentation sharing my insights and recomendations.
- Published a tableau dashboard sharing key metrics and insights, you can find it [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edgardo.rojas/viz/CyclisticsDashboard_16442743406030/CyclisticBikeServiceusercharacteristics)

## [SQL Side Project] psd missing project repository
I took on a small SQL project to learn more about creating databases and tables in SQL Server Management Studio.
- Imported the publicly available nashville housing dataset into a local server database in SSMS.
