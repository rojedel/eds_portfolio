# Edgardo's Analytics Portfolio

## [Project 1: Cyclistic bike service (Google Case Study)](https://github.com/rojedel/cyclistic-capstone-project/blob/main/Cyclsitic-Data-Analysis-Final.html)
This is a project I did as part of the google data analytics course. It is a capstone project where I got practice with all the tools and my recently learned data skills. The business task: Analyze Cyclistics bike sharing service usage data to find trends and insights into how different customer types use the service to find
ways to convert casual members into subscribers. 
- The data is from the divvy bike sharing service and is publicly available.
- I did exploratory data analysis in R, made visualizations with ggplot2, and worked with the tidyverse libraries.
- Created visualizations in tableau and a made a presentation sharing my insights and recomendations.
- Published a tableau dashboard sharing key metrics and insights, you can find it [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edgardo.rojas/viz/CyclisticsDashboard_16442743406030/CyclisticBikeServiceusercharacteristics)

## [SQL Side Project: Nashville Housing](https://github.com/rojedel/SQL-Side-Projects/blob/main/NashvilleHousing%20SQL%20CleaningV2.sql)
I took on a small SQL project to learn more about creating databases and tables in SQL Server Management Studio.
- Imported the publicly available nashville housing dataset into a local server database in SSMS.
- Performed data validation and data cleaning using SQL.
- Utilized self join, and CTE clauses.

## [Project 2: Bellabeat (Google Case Study)](https://github.com/rojedel/bellabeat-capstone-project)
This is the second capstone project of the google data analytics course. In this project I produced an analysis report explaining my reasoning and documenting the insights that were derived from the data. The business task was to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insights into how customers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Looking for insights into common usage trends to derive business value. 
- Utilized a publicly available dataset provided by Google, from public fitbit user data.
- Performed data cleaning, data validation and data analysis and developed a data analysis report with visualizations outlining the insights that were discovered.
- Visualizations done in R with the ggplot2 library.
- A big caveat is that the dataset is too small to make an accurate extraction of insights. More analysis is required with a bigger sample size in order to confirm the hypothesis.


## [Project 3: Data scrapping and exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/rojedel/Local_market_EDA)
In this project I built a data scraper python script to collect a grocery store product data. I got brand, pricing, department data on over 20K+ items. Using this dataset I set out to answer multiple business related questions on a Jupyter Notebook. I learned to use different python libraries such as pandas to wrangle data.
Some key aspects of this project.
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Etc.

## [**WIP**  Project 4: Machine learning model for NASA Jet Cycle data analysis]
I intend to build a machine learning model to perform predictions of remaining useful life for NASA's jet engines. This is an old dataset nasa made public for these kind of predictive analytics.
- Python
- Predictive analytics.
- Machine learning.
